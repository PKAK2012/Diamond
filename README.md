# Diamond
Overview
This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using machine learning regression models. The dataset contains various features such as carat weight, depth, table width, color, clarity, and more, which influence the price of a diamond.

 Dataset Description

cut-Quality of the diamond cut (Fair, Good, etc.)
color-Diamond color grade (E, F, G, etc.)
clarity-Clarity level of the diamond (VS1, SI1, etc.)
carat-Weight of the diamond
depth-Total depth percentage
table-Width of the top of the diamond
price-Price of the diamond (Target Variable)
x-Length of the diamond
y-Width of the diamond
z-Depth of the diamond

Machine Learning Approach
The dataset contains labeled data, meaning we have both input features (e.g., carat, depth, table, color, clarity, etc.) and output labels (price).
Since we are trying to predict price, this makes it a supervised learning problem.

The target variable price is continuous (numerical), which makes regression the right approach.
Regression models are used to predict numerical outcomes

This dataset is suitable for supervised Learning, here price column is a target varibale since it dependes on 
other features of the columns all other columns serve independent variable and price column contain 
numerical values this dataset is sutiable for regerssion task

Conclusion:
This dataset is well-suited for supervised learning with regression, with price as the target variable specially for regression task
